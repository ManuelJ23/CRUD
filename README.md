# C.R.U.D Project

- This is a To-do list in which you can perform the four basic operations that you have to be able to do with DDBB: **Create, Read, Update and Delete**.

- I built the app using *Python* and its Framework *Django*, and developed its interface with *HTML and Bootstrap.*

- Related to the Database, I started with *SQLite* (since Django has it by default) and then migrated the data to *Supabase*, and loaded it in an online *PostreSQL* Database.

> Note: There are many comments in the code since I was learning how to use Django and its functionalities while I was building the App.
